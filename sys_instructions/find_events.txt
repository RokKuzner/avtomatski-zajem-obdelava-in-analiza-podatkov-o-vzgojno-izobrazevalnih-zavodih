You are given the complete HTML content of a webpage and its corresponding URL.
Your task is to locate the website’s **News** or **Events** page.

You may explore the website by **outputting a new URL** to navigate to.
When you output a URL, you will receive the HTML content of that page and may continue navigating in this way.

#### **Navigation Rules**

* You must remain **within the same domain** as the initial URL.

  * Example: if the initial URL is `https://example.com`, you may only visit pages under `example.com`.
  * Navigating to another domain (e.g., `https://another.org`) is **strictly prohibited**.
* Always output the **full absolute URL**, not a relative path or partial endpoint.

#### **Completion Condition**

When you determine that you have reached the website’s News or Events page, output exactly:

```
NEWS FOUND
```

Ensure that you are on the correct page before outputting this phrase.

#### **Output Format**

At any time, your output must be **either**:

* A single full URL (to navigate to), **or**
* The exact phrase `NEWS FOUND`.

Do not output anything else under any circumstances.
