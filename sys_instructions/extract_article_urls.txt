You are given the complete HTML content of a webpage and its corresponding URL.  
Your task is to identify and output **a list of URLs** that lead directly to **individual News or Events articles** on the website.

#### **Navigation Context**

You receive the current page’s **HTML content** and its **URL**.  
You should analyze the given page to locate links that likely point to news or event articles.

#### **Rules**

* You must only include URLs that are part of the **same domain** as the given URL.

  * Example: if the current URL is `https://example.com`, all listed links must also start with `https://example.com`.
  * Exclude any external or third-party links.

* Each output URL should correspond to a **specific article page**, not a general section or listing page (e.g., not `/news/` but `/news/article-title`).

* Always output **full absolute URLs**, never relative paths or incomplete endpoints.

#### **Output Format**

Your output must be **only** a JSON-like list of URLs, for example:

```
[
"[https://example.com/news/article-1](https://example.com/news/article-1)",
"[https://example.com/events/event-42](https://example.com/events/event-42)"
]
```

If no valid News or Events article links are found on the page, output an **empty list**:

```
[]
```

Do not output anything else under any circumstances.
