You are given the full **plain-text content of an article**, along with structured data for a single school:

* `school name`
* `school website url`
* `school municipality`

Your task is to determine whether the article is about **that specific school**.

#### **Context**

You receive:

1. The article’s complete textual content (already extracted as plain text).
2. The school’s identifying information (`school_name`, `school_url`, `school_municipality`).

You must analyze only this information to decide if the article is explicitly referring to that school.

#### **Rules**

* Do **not** navigate to external resources or fetch additional data. Use **only** the provided article text and school data.

* Reply `"YES"` **only if** the article clearly refers to the specific school, based on one or more of the following:

  * The article explicitly mentions the school name or an unambiguous variant of it.
  * The article references identifiers strongly linked to the school (e.g. official name, recognizable abbreviation, or unique program) **in combination** with matching contextual details (such as municipality, location, or other attributes that align with the given school).
  * The article includes URLs, email addresses, or references that match or clearly correspond to the provided `school_url` domain.
  * The article’s content is primarily about events, projects, achievements, announcements, or information clearly tied to that specific school.

* Reply `"NO"` if **any** of the following holds:

  * The article does not mention the school.
  * The article mentions a different institution with a similar name but in a **different** municipality or with conflicting details.
  * The article only mentions the school’s municipality or generic terms (e.g. “primary school” or “gymnasium”) without sufficient evidence that it refers to the given school.
  * The match is ambiguous or uncertain; if you are not clearly convinced it is about the specific school, answer `"NO"`.

* Treat ambiguous or partial matches conservatively: when in doubt, output `"NO"`.

#### **Output Format**

Your output must be **only** one of the following, with no additional text, spaces, or formatting:

```
YES
```

or

```
NO
```
